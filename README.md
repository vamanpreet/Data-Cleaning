# UCI HAR Data Cleaning Project

This project aims to clean the UCI HAR Dataset, which contains data from accelerometers on a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

## Steps Performed:
1. Merged the training and test datasets.
2. Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset.
4. Appropriately labeled the dataset with descriptive variable names.
5. Created a second, independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The script `run_analysis.R` contains the code for this process.
